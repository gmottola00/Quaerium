"""Structural interfaces.

PEP 544 protocols, in Quaerium's house style: nothing has to inherit from
anything, a class just has to have the right shape. This is what lets the
session store swap between Redis and a dict, and a capability swap between a
live client and a fake, without a base class in sight.

"""Policy gate node.

The one place a human is asked. Every tool call the model made passes through
here and comes out in one of two buckets: cleared to run, or refused with a
result the model can read.

Suspension uses LangGraph's ``interrupt``, which checkpoints the whole run. The
process can be restarted, the browser can be closed, and the pending approval is
still there when you come back — that is the difference between a dialog and a
gate.

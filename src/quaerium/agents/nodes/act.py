Runs the cleared tool calls and hands every result back in a single user message.

That last part is not a detail: splitting tool results across several messages
teaches the model to stop asking for parallel calls, and the whole point of the
``TaskGroup`` below is to answer three independent questions in one round trip
instead of three.
